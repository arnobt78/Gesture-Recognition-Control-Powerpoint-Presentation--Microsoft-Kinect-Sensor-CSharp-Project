<!-- 
    MainWindow.xaml - Defines the user interface layout for the Kinect PowerPoint Control application
    
    This XAML file creates a window that displays:
    1. Live video feed from the Kinect RGB camera
    2. Three tracking circles (ellipses) that follow the user's head and hands
    3. Visual feedback when gestures are detected (circles grow and turn green)
